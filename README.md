# Traffic Light Detection using YOLO

## Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a robust traffic light detection and classification system using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and deploy it into a web application to analyze input video frames. The primary objective of this system is to accurately detect and classify traffic lights into three distinct classes: red, green, and yellow. Additionally, the system will include an â€œoff" class to handle instances where a traffic light is not detected in the input video frame.
The system can provide valuable information to assist in decision-making processes, improve traffic flow, and enhance road safety. The use of YOLOv8, a powerful object detection model, enables the system to detect with high accuracy and performance suitable with the project use case.


## Traffic Dataset V8

The project uses the Traffic dataset V8, a collection of images encompassing 4 different light classes (Red, Yellow, Green and OFF). It includes a total of 6,259 images, split into 4,860 training images,931 validation image and 468 test images. Each class has a substantial number of images, ensuring robust training and testing of machine learning models.

- **Total Images:** 6,259
- **Training Images:** 4,860
- **Validation Images:** 931
- **Test Images:** 468
- **Image Size:** 640x640 pixels (original size varies)
- **Classes:** 4 Lighting types

The dataset is structured in directories for lighting types Red, Green, Yellow and OFF
